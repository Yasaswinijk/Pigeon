# Automated Indian Sign Language Translation

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hearing-impaired community by providing an automated translation of video content (such as news) into Indian Sign Language (ISL). Inspired by the lack of accessibility to vital information, especially news, for the deaf community, the system utilizes YouTube's Transcript API to extract video content and translates it into ISL. This idea was initially inspired by Doordarshan's programming and aims to enhance accessibility and inclusivity.

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts transcripts from YouTube videos using **YouTube Transcript API**
- Processes text using **Python** and **Gemini API**
- Converts extracted text into ISL representations (future scope)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python
- **APIs**: YouTube Transcript API
- **Frontend**: React (Planned)


## 🎯 Motivation
The inspiration behind this project is to make information like news accessible to the deaf community, who often miss out on vital updates due to the absence of sign language interpretation. This project is a small step towards that, with research and the integration of more comprehensive datasets still required for improvement. Further research and collaboration are needed to develop a robust ISL translation system with proper linguistic datasets.This is a **small step** towards making information more accessible.



## 📌 Future Improvements
- Enhance ISL translation accuracy with **deep learning models**
- Expand dataset for **better contextual understanding**
- Implement **real-time video translation**
